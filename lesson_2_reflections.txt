What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Call git init. Because the repository needs a .git hidden folder to store the status and other meta data of the files in the repository.
I need also run git status to confirm the repository created.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is the place to record what are going to commit. It provides a single commit command to commit multiple files.
